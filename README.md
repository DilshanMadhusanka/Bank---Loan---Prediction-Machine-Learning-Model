# Bank Loan Default Risk Prediction Model

## Overview

This machine learning model predicts the risk of default for bank loans, aiding in the decision-making process for loan approval.

## Features

- Utilizes historical loan data for training and validation.
- Includes various features such as borrower's credit score, income, loan amount, loan term, etc.
- Implements a classification algorithm to categorize loans as either low-risk or high-risk based on default probability.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Jupyter Notebook for model development and analysis

## How to Use

- Install Python 3.x and required libraries (Scikit-learn, Pandas).
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Open the Jupyter Notebook file loan_default_prediction.ipynb.
- Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to:
- Load and preprocess the loan data.
- Train and evaluate the machine learning model.
- Predict loan default risk for new loan applications.
- Customize the model as needed for specific bank requirements or data sources.

## Model Evaluation

- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Validate the model using cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness and generalization.
